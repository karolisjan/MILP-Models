# MILP Models

Implementations of various mixed-integer linear programming ([MILP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)) models including but not limited to the capacity planning and scheduling models of biopharmaceutical manufacture. 

## General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS)

The models have been implemented using both [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/products/introduction/) v23.9.5 and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language (with [JuMP](http://www.juliaopt.org/) optimisation package).

[Here](lakhdar2005/example1.ipynb) is a complete example of a capacity planning MILP model solved using Julia.
