# MILP Models

Implementations of various mixed-integer linear programming ([MILP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)) models including but not limited to the capacity planning and scheduling models of biopharmaceutical manufacture. 

## General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS)

The models have been implemented using GAMS v23.9.5.

[GAMS](https://www.gams.com/products/introduction/) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical programming and optimization. It consists of a language compiler and a stable of integrated high-performance solvers.
